  #Functionality
  For my midterm project, I made a cool system with buttons and lights. The yellow button turns the Wemos on and off, the green one turns the Hue lights on and off, the grey and blue buttons switch between different lights and Wemos, and the red button changes the color of the Hue lights. The little screen shows which Wemo and Hue light is picked, if they are on or off, how bright the light is, and if it’s dark or light because the Neopixels turn red when it’s dark and turn off when it’s light.

  #story behind it
  I made this project because I really like remotes that can control lights in a room. I think it's fun to be able to turn lights on and off, change their color, and make LED strips brighter or dimmer just by pressing buttons.
